# quarto
A Python implementation of Quarto game, with varioux algorithms.

## Presentation

Quarto is an interesting abstract 2-player game (0-sum) with complete information.
It can be used as a toy environment for the test of various algorithms.

## Usage

Objective is to have 3 possible interfaces with the game :

- CLI

- web app

- GUI (pygame)

The goal is to have some nice parametrisation and visualisation of various algorithms.

## Optimisation

WIP : have a C implementation of Quarto and expose it to python via cffi module.
