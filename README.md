# quarto
A Python implementation of Quarto game, with varioux algorithms.

## Presentation

Quarto is an interesting abstract 2-player game (0-sum) with complete information.
It can be used as a toy environment for the test of various algorithms.

## Usage

Currently, interface is through flask app (with noobish VueJS frontend).

Go to flask directory and run `app.py` to serve default server on port 5000. `localhost:5000` will server the game.

The goal is to have some nice parametrisation and visualisation of various algorithms.

## Checklist

1. add better user interface

2. have bot parameter customisation and game setup

3. have more bot types

4. manage multi games with different users

5. store game data in a database
